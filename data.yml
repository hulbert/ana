          <h2>Clinical correlate: Insertion for gluteus minimus and gluteus medius</h2>
          <p>
              Gluteal injections are considered to be &ldquo;safe&rdquo; in the superolateral quadrant of buttock. 
              If iatrogenic inferior gluteal nerve injury occurs (i.e. from improper injection site), Trendelenburg sign can occur.

          <h2>Clinical correlate: Trochanteric bursitis</h2>
          <p>
              A bursa is a small, fluid filled sac that functions to reduce friction between tendons and bone. 
              In trochanteric bursitis, there is inflammation of the bursa that overlies the greater trochanter. 
              Symptoms include pain directly over greater trochanter with walking and laying on affected side. 
              Treatment is rest, ice, stretching, strengthening, steroid injection into bursa, or bursectomy (rarely).

              The medial and lateral epicondyles of the femur are palpable landmarks.

              After acetabular or femoral shaft fractures, the  
              It is important for the femur to be kept out to its normal length until surgical fixation can occur. 
              To accomplish this, a metal traction pin can be drilled through the distal femur and connected to 10 to 20 pounds of weight.
